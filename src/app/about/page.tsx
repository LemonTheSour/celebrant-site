              The Experience Factor
            </h2>
            <div className="text-sm mb-4">
              I love being a Marriage Celebrant and am passionate about what I
              do. I spent a year training to get my qualifications and continue
              with yearly training programs, and staying up-to-date with the
              latest trends With the experience I have gained I have learnt to
              handle any unexpected hiccups that can happen during your
              ceremony. Every wedding is different as is every Couple and my aim
              is to have a smooth and stress-free event. As every wedding is
              different, and every single couple that comes to me is different,
              I have to be adaptable and have the knowledge and experience to be
              able to create the perfect ceremony for each couple.
